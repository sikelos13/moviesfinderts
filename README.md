## Moviesfinder-project

This is an end-to-end search dashboard for education purposes.Build with create-react-app and typescript template and for the backend node.js.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and npm install the dependecies.

## How it Works

Run the app with `npm run start` . The server listens to :8000 port and frontend at :3000. 
For storing data we are using a in-memory MongoDB that you can connect with mongodb://localhost:27017/movieFinder 

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## How We built the Scripting/Parsing Tool.

We worked on plain with typescript ,loadash, sass and node.js .For styling we followed Material Ui theme guidelines and for our REST we used Node.js.
